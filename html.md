 # html

 > I have learnt about the tags, the html tags, 
   starting from the headings for example;the h1,h2
   and the rest. The tags have different functions 
   they perform i.e *how bold each text in each 
   tag appears*.Other tags include :

 - p tag for paragraph

 - span tag which gives room for any text and diplay it as it was written in it. *div* also has the same function as **span**

 - *br* this is for line breaks.
