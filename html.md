 # html

 > I have learnt about the tags, the html tags, 
   starting from the headings for example;*<h1></h1>,<h2></h2>*
   and the rest. The tags have different functions 
   they perform i.e *how bold each text in each 
   tag appears*.Other tags include :

 - [<p></p>] for paragraph

 - **<span></span>** which gives room for any text and diplay it as it was written in it.**<div></div>**also has the same function as **<span></span>**

 - **<br></br>** this is for line breaks.
